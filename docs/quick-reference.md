## Common Scenarios Cheat Sheet

### Scenario 1: Teaching Basic Seasons
```
Latitude: 45°
Axial Tilt: 23.4° (Earth)
View: 24 Hours

Compare:
• Jun Solstice: High sun (~70°), 15-16h daylight
• Dec Solstice: Low sun (~20°), 8-9h daylight
```

### Scenario 2: Equator Has No Seasons
```
Latitude: 0°
Axial Tilt: 23.4° (Earth)
View: 365 Days

Observe:
• Nearly flat line
• Always ~12h daylight
• Sun altitude varies only 67°-90°
```

### Scenario 3: Midnight Sun
```
Latitude: 70°
Date: Jun Solstice
View: 24 Hours

Result:
• Sun never sets
• Dips to ~5° at "midnight"
• 24 hours of daylight!
```

### Scenario 4: Polar Night
```
Latitude: 70°
Date: Dec Solstice
View: 24 Hours

Result:
• Sun never rises
• Stays below horizon
• 0 hours of daylight
```

### Scenario 5: No Axial Tilt World
```
Latitude: Any
Axial Tilt: 0°
View: 365 Days

Result:
• Flat line (no variation)
• Always 12h daylight everywhere
• No seasons exist!
```

### Scenario 6: Extreme Tilt Planet
```
Latitude: 45°
Axial Tilt: 82.2° (Uranus)
View: 365 Days

Result:
• Huge seasonal swings
• Arctic Circle at 8° latitude
• Extreme seasonal variation
```

### Scenario 7: Comparing Hemispheres
```
Settings A: Latitude 45°, Jun Solstice
Settings B: Latitude -45°, Jun Solstice
View: 24 Hours

Observe:
• Same date, opposite seasons
• Northern summer = Southern winter
```

### Scenario 8: Equinoxes
```
Latitude: 45°
Date: Mar or Sep Equinox
View: 24 Hours

Result:
• ~12h daylight
• Sun rises due east, sets due west
• Declination = 0°
```

## Quick Teaching Tips

### Starting a Demo
1. ✅ Start with 24 Hours view
2. ✅ Use your local latitude
3. ✅ Begin with Jun Solstice
4. ✅ Click play to animate
5. ✅ Compare to Dec Solstice

### Effective Questioning
- **Before changing:** "What do you predict will happen?"
- **After observing:** "Why did that happen?"
- **Connect to life:** "When have you experienced this?"

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Don't change multiple variables at once
- ❌ Don't skip the prediction step
- ❌ Don't forget to address misconceptions
- ✅ One change at a time
- ✅ Predict before testing
- ✅ Explicitly discuss distance vs. tilt

## Key Formulas & Relationships

### Important Latitudes
```
Tropic of Cancer/Capricorn = ±(Axial Tilt)
  Earth: ±23.45°

Arctic/Antarctic Circle = ±(90° - Axial Tilt)
  Earth: ±66.55°
```

### Key Dates (Northern Hemisphere)
```
Mar 20-21: Spring Equinox (declination = 0°)
Jun 20-21: Summer Solstice (declination = +23.45°)
Sep 22-23: Fall Equinox (declination = 0°)
Dec 21-22: Winter Solstice (declination = -23.45°)
```

### Altitude Values
```
0° = Horizon (sunrise/sunset)
90° = Zenith (directly overhead)
Negative = Below horizon (nighttime)
```

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

| Problem | Quick Fix |
|---------|-----------|
| Controls not working | Refresh page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R) |
| Graph looks wrong | Reset zoom (Ctrl+0 or Cmd+0) |
| Slow performance | Close other browser tabs |
| Can't see full graph | Switch to Auto y-axis mode |
| Confused by display | Switch to 24 Hours view, use presets |

## Assessment Quick Ideas

### 5-Second Checks
- "Thumbs up if you think daylight will be longer at 60° than 30°"
- "Point to where the sun is at noon on this graph"
- "Which season is this? Show 1, 2, 3, or 4 fingers"

### 1-Minute Writes
- "Explain why the Arctic has midnight sun"
- "Draw the sun's path for winter at mid-latitudes"
- "Predict what happens if we double Earth's tilt"

### 5-Minute Tasks
- Compare two screenshots and explain differences
- Find a latitude with specific characteristics
- Create a scenario that matches given criteria

## Parent Communication Template

```
Dear Parents,

We're using an interactive tool called "Sun in Sky"
to learn about seasons and how the sun's position
changes throughout the year.

Students can access it at: [YOUR_URL]

Your child might enjoy:
• Setting the latitude to our city
• Finding their birthday and seeing the sun's path
• Comparing to other locations they've visited

This helps them understand why we have seasons and
why different parts of the world experience different
amounts of daylight.

Questions? Email me at: [YOUR_EMAIL]
```

## Emergency Backup Activities

If tech fails:

1. **Draw it:** Sketch predicted sun paths on whiteboard
2. **Act it out:** Physical model with student as Earth, lamp as sun
3. **Video:** Pre-recorded screen capture of demonstrations
4. **Screenshots:** Printed scenarios for paper-based analysis
5. **Discussion:** Verbal exploration of concepts without tool
