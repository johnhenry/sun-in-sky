## Activity 9: Arctic Circle Explorer

**Time:** 20 minutes
**Difficulty:** Medium-Hard
**Best for:** Mathematical relationships

### Objective
Understand the relationship between axial tilt and Arctic Circle location.

### Part 1: Finding the Pattern

**Setup:** Use your local latitude (or 45°), June Solstice, 24h view

Complete the table:

| Axial Tilt | Arctic Circle Latitude | What You Observe at Arctic Circle |
|------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 0° | N/A | (no Arctic Circle exists) |
| 10° | | |
| 23.4° | | |
| 45° | | |
| 66.6° | | |
| 82.2° | | |

**Hint:** To find Arctic Circle, look for blue tick marks on latitude slider

### Answer Key

| Tilt | Arctic Circle | Observation |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| 0° | N/A | No midnight sun possible |
| 10° | 80° | Tiny Arctic Circle, brief midnight sun |
| 23.4° | 66.6° | Earth's actual Arctic Circle |
| 45° | 45° | Arctic Circle at mid-latitudes! |
| 66.6° | 23.4° | Arctic Circle at tropics! |
| 82.2° | 7.8° | Arctic Circle very close to equator |

### Part 2: Discover the Formula

Look at the relationship between tilt angle and Arctic Circle latitude.

**Pattern:** Arctic Circle = _______ - Axial Tilt

**Answer:** 90° - Axial Tilt

**Why this works:**
The Arctic Circle is the latitude where the sun just touches the horizon at midnight on the summer solstice. This occurs at 90° minus the tilt angle.

### Part 3: Predictions

Use your formula to predict:

1. If Earth's tilt was 30°, where would the Arctic Circle be?
   - **Answer:** 60°

2. If you wanted the Arctic Circle at 70°, what tilt would you need?
   - **Answer:** 20°

3. What tilt would put the Arctic Circle at the equator?
   - **Answer:** 90° (maximum possible tilt)

### Part 4: Tropical Connection

**Bonus discovery:** Where are the Tropics located relative to tilt?

Test and find:
- Tropic latitude = _______ (same as axial tilt!)

**Why this works:**
The Tropics mark the farthest north/south where the sun can be directly overhead (90°). This equals the maximum declination, which equals the axial tilt.

### Extension Challenge
Graph the relationship between axial tilt (x-axis) and Arctic Circle latitude (y-axis). What kind of relationship is it?
- **Answer:** Linear, with slope -1 and y-intercept 90

- Max altitude: ~73°
- Daylight: ~15h
- Sunrise: ~4:30
- Sunset: ~19:30
- Season: Summer

**40° South:**
- Max altitude: ~27°
- Daylight: ~9h
- Sunrise: ~7:30
- Sunset: ~16:30
- Season: Winter

### Part 2: Switch Dates

**Now test December 21**

Prediction: What will happen?

Test and record - were you correct?

**Answer:** Patterns reverse! Northern Hemisphere now has winter values, Southern has summer values.

### Part 3: Year View Comparison

Both partners switch to 365 Days view at their latitudes.

Sketch both curves on the same graph (use different colors).

**Observations:**
- How are the curves related? _______________
- When one is at maximum, the other is at: _______________
- The curves are __________ of each other.

**Answer:**
- Mirror images / opposite phases
- When one is at max, other is at minimum
- The curves are inverse/opposite of each other

### Part 4: Explanation

Work together to explain:

**Why do hemispheres have opposite seasons?**

Key points to include:
- Earth's tilt direction stays constant
- When Northern Hemisphere tilts toward sun (summer), Southern tilts away (winter)
- This reverses 6 months later as Earth orbits
- Both hemispheres receive same total sunlight over the year

### Extension: Equator Exception

Test latitude 0° (equator):
- Does it follow either hemisphere's pattern?
- Why or why not?

**Answer:** No! Equator has minimal seasonal variation, always ~12h daylight. It doesn't "belong" to either hemisphere's seasonal pattern.

## Activity 14: Mars Migration

**Time:** 35 minutes
**Difficulty:** Hard
**Best for:** Applying knowledge to new context

### Objective
Plan a Mars base location considering Martian seasonal patterns.

### Background

**Mars Facts:**
- Axial tilt: 25.2° (similar to Earth's 23.4°!)
- Year length: 687 Earth days (nearly twice as long)
- Atmosphere: Very thin
- Temperature: Much colder than Earth

**Your Mission:** Choose the best latitude for a Mars base.

### Requirements Analysis

Your Mars base needs:
1. ✅ Consistent sunlight for solar panels (prefer 10+ hours year-round)
2. ✅ Avoid extreme darkness (no polar night)
3. ✅ Moderate sun angles for temperature regulation
4. ✅ Some seasonal variation acceptable
5. ✅ Access to both hemispheres (mid-latitude preferred)

### Investigation

**Setup:** Axial Tilt 25.2° (Mars preset), 24 Hours view

Test these candidate latitudes:

### Answer Key

**0° (Equator):**
- Summer: 12h, 65°
- Winter: 12h, 65°
- Pros: Consistent! No polar night. Predictable.
- Cons: Less access to polar ice. No flexibility.

**30°:**
- Summer: 14h, 80°
- Winter: 10h, 35°
- Pros: Good balance. Meets 10h requirement. Moderate variation.
- Cons: Winter sun angle low.

**45°:**
- Summer: 15h, 70°
- Winter: 9h, 20°
- Pros: Long summer days. Mid-latitude location.
- Cons: **Fails 10h requirement in winter!**

**60°:**
- Summer: 18h, 55°
- Winter: 6h, 5°
- Pros: Abundant summer sun. Near polar resources.
- Cons: **Fails 10h requirement badly!** Very extreme.

### Decision Matrix

| Latitude | Consistency | Winter Light | Seasonal Balance | TOTAL |
|----------|-------------|--------------|------------------|-------|
| 0° | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 15/15 |
| 30° | 4/5 | 5/5 | 4/5 | 13/15 |
| 45° | 3/5 | 3/5 | 3/5 | 9/15 |
| 60° | 1/5 | 1/5 | 2/5 | 4/15 |

### Recommendation

**Best latitude for Mars base:** _________

**Justification (write 3-4 sentences):**

_______________________________________________

### Sample Answer

**Recommendation:** 30° latitude (Northern or Southern)

**Justification:**
The 30° latitude offers the best balance for a Mars base. It provides at least 10 hours of daylight year-round, meeting our solar panel requirements. The seasonal variation (14h to 10h) is manageable and provides some flexibility. While the equator is more consistent, 30° offers better access to mid-latitude regions for exploration and potential resources, while avoiding the extreme winter darkness of higher latitudes.

### Extension: Earth vs Mars

Using Earth settings (23.4° tilt), would your recommendation change?
- Test same latitudes
- Compare to Mars data
- Explain any differences

**Key finding:** Very similar! Mars and Earth have comparable tilts, so seasonal patterns are alike.
