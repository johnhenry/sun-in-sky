## Introduction (10 minutes)

### Engaging Hook: The Shadow Mystery
"Imagine you're a detective solving a crime that happened at noon. The only clue? A photograph showing someone's shadow. Can you determine what time of year the crime occurred? What if I told you the shadow's length can reveal the date?"

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Have you noticed that shadows change length throughout the day? Throughout the year?
2. Why do you think this happens?
3. What does this tell us about the sun's position?

### Real-World Connection
Show images of:
- Solar panels on roofs (angle matters for efficiency)
- Sundials (ancient timekeeping using sun position)
- Ancient monuments like Stonehenge (aligned with solstice sunrise)
- Photographers planning "golden hour" shots

**Bridge to Activity:**
"Today, we're going to become solar scientists. We'll use real astronomical calculations—the same ones NASA uses—to understand exactly where the sun is in the sky at any moment."

## Main Activity (Day 1: 30 minutes)

### Part A: Introduction to the Sun in Sky App (10 minutes)

**Teacher Demonstration:**
1. Open the Sun in Sky app and project it for the class
2. Explain the interface components:
   - X-axis: Time of day (0:00 to 24:00)
   - Y-axis: Solar altitude in degrees
   - Yellow-orange curve: The sun's path across the sky
   - Purple dot: Current time marker
   - Orange dashed line: Horizon (0°)

3. Demonstrate the controls:
   - Date slider (change day of year)
   - Latitude slider (change observer location)
   - Time presets (Midnight, Dawn, Noon, Dusk)
   - Play button (animate through the day)

4. Key observation: "Notice how the curve shows negative values. What do you think negative altitude means?" (Sun is below the horizon—nighttime)

### Part B: Guided Data Collection (20 minutes)

**Investigation Question:** How does solar altitude change throughout a single day at your latitude?

**Setup Instructions:**
1. Students work in pairs
2. Set the app to March Equinox (Mar Equinox button)
3. Set latitude to 45° (close to mid-latitude locations like Minneapolis, Portland, Turin)
4. Switch to Day View if not already selected
5. Set Y-axis to "Fixed (±90°)" for consistent measurement

**Data Collection Task:**
Students complete the following table by moving the time slider and recording altitude:

| Time of Day | Solar Altitude (°) | Sun Position |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Midnight (0:00) | | |
| 3:00 AM | | |
| 6:00 AM (Dawn) | | |
| 9:00 AM | | |
| Noon (12:00) | | |
| 3:00 PM | | |
| 6:00 PM (Dusk) | | |
| 9:00 PM | | |

**For "Sun Position" column, students write:**
- "Below horizon" if altitude is negative
- "Above horizon" if altitude is positive
- Note the sunrise and sunset times (when curve crosses 0°)

**Analysis Questions (on worksheet):**
1. At what time does the sun reach its maximum altitude?
2. What is the maximum altitude on the equinox at 45°N?
3. Is the sun's path symmetric? (Does it rise and set at equal angles?)
4. How many hours of daylight are there? (Count hours when altitude > 0°)
5. What pattern does the altitude curve make? (arc, straight line, wave, etc.)

## Main Activity (Day 2: 35 minutes)

### Part C: Latitude Comparison Investigation (20 minutes)

**Investigation Question:** How does latitude affect solar altitude?

**Experimental Design:**
Students will compare solar altitude at noon for five different latitudes, all on the March Equinox.

**Control Variables:**
- Date: March Equinox (declination = 0°)
- Time: Noon (12:00)
- Axial tilt: 23.4° (Earth)

**Independent Variable:** Latitude
**Dependent Variable:** Maximum solar altitude (at noon)

**Data Collection:**

| Latitude | Location Type | Max Altitude at Noon | Calculation: 90° - Latitude | Difference |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|----------------------------|------------|
| 0° | Equator | | | |
| 23.4° | Tropic | | | |
| 45° | Mid-latitude | | | |
| 66.6° | Arctic Circle | | | |
| 90° | North Pole | | | |

**Procedure:**
1. Set date to March Equinox
2. Set time to Noon
3. For each latitude, record the maximum altitude
4. Calculate 90° minus the latitude
5. Compare your measured value to your calculated value
6. Determine the difference (should be close to 0° on equinox)

**Discovery Moment:**
"You've just discovered a fundamental law of solar geometry! On the equinox, the maximum solar altitude equals 90° minus your latitude. This is why the sun never goes directly overhead except at the equator!"

### Part D: Declination Effects (15 minutes)

**Investigation Question:** How does the time of year change solar altitude?

**Setup:**
- Keep latitude at 45°
- Keep time at Noon
- Change dates only

**Data Collection:**

| Date | Day of Year | Solar Declination | Max Altitude at Noon | Change from Equinox |
|------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Jan 1 | 1 | (read from app) | | |
| Mar Equinox | 80 | 0° | | 0° (baseline) |
| Jun Solstice | 172 | +23.4° | | |
| Sep Equinox | 266 | 0° | | |
| Dec Solstice | 355 | -23.4° | | |

**Analysis Questions:**
1. On which date is the sun highest in the sky?
2. On which date is the sun lowest at noon?
3. What is the total range of altitude throughout the year? (Max - Min)
4. How does this range compare to Earth's axial tilt (23.4°)?
5. Predict: What would happen to this range if Earth had no axial tilt?

**Mathematical Challenge (Advanced Students):**
On the equinox at 45°N, maximum altitude = 45°.
On June solstice, maximum altitude should be: 45° + 23.4° = 68.4°
On December solstice, maximum altitude should be: 45° - 23.4° = 21.6°

Verify these calculations using the app!

## Extension Activities

### For Advanced Students

**1. Mathematical Modeling**
Challenge: Derive the solar altitude formula for noon:
- At noon, hour angle = 0°
- Formula simplifies to: sin(altitude) = sin(latitude) × sin(declination) + cos(latitude) × cos(declination)
- For declination = 0° (equinox), this becomes: altitude = 90° - latitude
- Prove this algebraically

**2. Planetary Engineer**
"Design a planet where the sun reaches 90° altitude at 50°N latitude on the summer solstice. What would the axial tilt need to be?"
(Answer: 40°, because tilt + latitude = 90° at tropic zenith passage)

**3. Historical Astronomy**
Research how ancient civilizations used solar altitude for:
- Timekeeping (sundials)
- Navigation (measuring latitude with sextants)
- Calendar creation (observing solstices)
- Religious/ceremonial structures (Stonehenge, pyramids)

### For All Students

**4. Photograph Analysis**
Take a photo of a shadow at the same time each week for a month. Measure shadow length and use trigonometry to calculate solar altitude: tan(altitude) = height ÷ shadow length

**5. Local Investigation**
Find your actual latitude using GPS. Use the app to:
- Predict today's sunrise and sunset times
- Compare to published data (timeanddate.com)

## Teacher Notes & Tips

### Common Student Misconceptions
1. **"The sun is closer in summer"** - Address that seasons are caused by angle, not distance
2. **"The sun rises exactly east and sets exactly west"** - True only on equinoxes
3. **"Solar altitude is the same everywhere at noon"** - Varies by latitude and date
4. **"Negative altitude means the sun is underground"** - Clarify it means below horizon, sun is on other side of Earth

### Technical Tips
- Test the app before class to ensure it loads properly
- Bookmark the app URL for easy access
- For classes without 1:1 devices, use a projector and have students work in larger groups
- Consider printing screenshots for students without digital access

### Time Management
- Day 1 can extend to 50 minutes if students need more time with data collection
- Day 2 can be shortened by doing Part D as a demonstration instead of individual work
- Extension activities can be homework or extra credit

### Safety & Inclusivity
- **NEVER look directly at the sun** - emphasize we're using a computer model
- Ensure colorblind students can read the graphs (use labels, not just color)
- Provide text descriptions of all visual elements
- Consider students in different hemispheres (discuss both N and S latitudes)

## Main Activity - Day 1 (30 minutes)

### Part A: Discovering the Arctic Circle (15 minutes)

**Investigation Question:** At what latitude does the midnight sun begin to occur?

**Scientific Prediction:**
Before using the app, students predict:
- "I think midnight sun occurs at latitudes beyond _____° because _____"
- "I think this is related to Earth's axial tilt of 23.45° because _____"

**Experimental Setup:**
- Date: June Solstice (day 172)
- Time: View entire day using Day View
- Axial Tilt: 23.4° (Earth)
- Y-axis mode: Dynamic (for best visibility)

**Procedure:**
Students systematically test latitudes and record results:

| Latitude | Minimum Altitude (at midnight) | Does Sun Set? | Daylight Hours |
|----------|-------------------------------|--------------|----------------|
| 60°N | | Yes / No | |
| 63°N | | Yes / No | |
| 66°N | | Yes / No | |
| 66.6°N | | Yes / No | |
| 67°N | | Yes / No | |
| 70°N | | Yes / No | |
| 75°N | | Yes / No | |
| 80°N | | Yes / No | |
| 85°N | | Yes / No | |
| 90°N | | Yes / No | |

**Instructions for "Does Sun Set?":**
- If the entire curve is above 0° (horizon), write "No"
- If the curve dips below 0°, write "Yes"
- Look for the app's "Midnight Sun" indicator

**Guided Discovery Questions:**
1. At approximately what latitude does midnight sun begin? (Look for the transition latitude)
2. What is the relationship between this latitude and Earth's 23.4° tilt? (Hint: 90° - 23.4° = ?)
3. How does the minimum altitude change as you move toward the pole?
4. At the North Pole (90°), what is the sun's altitude at midnight?

**Key Discovery:**
Students should discover that the Arctic Circle is at 66.55°N (90° - 23.45°), and this is not a coincidence—it's mathematically determined by Earth's axial tilt.

### Part B: Investigating Polar Night (15 minutes)

**Investigation Question:** When and where does polar night occur?

**Experimental Setup:**
- Date: December Solstice (day 355)
- Keep all other settings the same
- Test the same latitudes

**Data Collection:**

| Latitude | Maximum Altitude (at noon) | Does Sun Rise? | Daylight Hours |
|----------|---------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| 60°N | | Yes / No | |
| 66.6°N | | Yes / No | |
| 70°N | | Yes / No | |
| 75°N | | Yes / No | |
| 80°N | | Yes / No | |
| 90°N | | Yes / No | |

**Analysis Questions:**
1. At what latitude does polar night begin?
2. Is this the same as where midnight sun occurs? Why?
3. What is the sun's altitude at noon at the North Pole during winter solstice?
4. How does this compare to the summer solstice altitude?

**Mathematical Connection:**
At the poles:
- Summer solstice altitude = axial tilt (23.4°)
- Winter solstice altitude = -axial tilt (-23.4°)
- The sun circles the horizon without setting or rising!

## Main Activity - Day 2 (35 minutes)

### Part C: Quantifying Daylight Hours Throughout the Year (20 minutes)

**Investigation Question:** How do daylight hours change throughout the year at different latitudes?

**Experimental Design:**
Students will track daylight hours throughout the year for three latitudes:
- 45°N (mid-latitude, for comparison)
- 70°N (inside Arctic Circle)
- 90°N (North Pole)

**Data Collection Table:**

| Date | Day # | 45°N Daylight | 70°N Daylight | 90°N Daylight |
|------|-------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Jan 1 | 1 | | | |
| Feb 1 | 32 | | | |
| Mar Equinox | 80 | | | |
| Apr 1 | 91 | | | |
| May 1 | 121 | | | |
| Jun Solstice | 172 | | | |
| Jul 1 | 182 | | | |
| Aug 1 | 213 | | | |
| Sep Equinox | 266 | | | |
| Oct 1 | 274 | | | |
| Nov 1 | 305 | | | |
| Dec Solstice | 355 | | | |

**How to Read Daylight Hours:**
The app displays daylight hours in the stats panel when in Day View. Students should:
1. Set the date
2. Set the latitude
3. Read the "Daylight" value displayed
4. Record it in the table

**Graphing Activity:**
On graph paper, create a line graph with:
- X-axis: Months (Jan-Dec)
- Y-axis: Daylight hours (0-24)
- Three different colored lines for the three latitudes
- Label equinoxes and solstices

**Analysis Questions:**
1. Which latitude shows the most extreme variation in daylight hours?
2. At what latitudes and dates do you see exactly 12 hours of daylight?
3. For how many days does the North Pole have continuous daylight? Continuous darkness?
4. Describe the pattern at 45°N. Is it linear or curved? Why?
5. On the equinoxes, what do you notice about daylight hours at ALL latitudes?

### Part D: The Ultimate Extreme - Life at the Poles (15 minutes)

**Investigation Question:** How does the sun's path differ at the North Pole vs. mid-latitudes?

**Comparative Analysis:**
Students will compare the sun's annual path at two locations.

**Setup for Location 1 - Mid-Latitude:**
- Latitude: 45°N
- View: Year View
- Date: Animate through entire year

**Setup for Location 2 - North Pole:**
- Latitude: 90°N
- View: Year View
- Date: Animate through entire year

**Observation Prompts:**
Watch the year-long animation and sketch the general pattern:

**At 45°N, I observe:**
- The curve is _______________ (wavy, flat, zig-zag)
- The maximum altitude occurs in _______ (month)
- The minimum altitude occurs in _______ (month)
- The curve crosses the horizon _____ times per year

**At 90°N, I observe:**
- The curve is _______________ (wavy, flat, zig-zag)
- The maximum altitude is approximately _____°
- The minimum altitude is approximately _____°
- The curve crosses the horizon _____ times per year
- For how many months is it above the horizon? _____
- For how many months is it below the horizon? _____

**Critical Thinking Question:**
"At the North Pole, the sun rises once and sets once per year. When do you think sunrise occurs? Sunset? Use the app to verify your prediction."

**Answer:**
- Sunrise: March Equinox (sun's declination becomes positive)
- Sunset: September Equinox (sun's declination becomes negative)
- The sun then spirals upward for 3 months, reaches maximum altitude at June solstice, spirals downward for 3 months, then sets

## Teacher Notes & Tips

### Common Student Misconceptions

1. **"Midnight sun means the sun is directly overhead at midnight"**
   - Correction: The sun is low on the horizon, just never sets
   - At the Arctic Circle, midnight sun barely grazes the horizon
   - Even at North Pole, maximum altitude is only 23.45°

2. **"Polar night means complete darkness"**
   - Correction: There is still twilight for several hours per day at most locations
   - Only at the poles is it truly dark for extended periods

3. **"Midnight sun only occurs at the North Pole"**
   - Correction: Occurs at all latitudes above Arctic Circle
   - Duration increases as you move toward the pole

4. **"The Arctic Circle is a random boundary"**
   - Correction: It's mathematically determined: 90° - axial tilt
   - Changes slightly over millennia as Earth's tilt varies

## Introduction (15 minutes)

### Engaging Hook: The Temperature Mystery

**Present this puzzle to students:**
"On June 21, the sun shines for 24 hours at the North Pole but only 15 hours in Miami, Florida. Yet Miami is HOT (averaging 28°C/82°F) while the North Pole is COLD (averaging 0°C/32°F). How can this be?"

**Student Predictions:**
Have students write their hypothesis explaining this apparent contradiction.

**Reveal the Key:**
Show two images side-by-side:
1. Midnight sun at North Pole (sun barely above horizon at 23.4°)
2. Noon sun in Miami (sun high in sky at 89°)

**Critical Realization:**
"It's not just about how LONG the sun shines—it's about the ANGLE at which sunlight hits Earth!"

### Real-World Connection: The Flashlight Demonstration

**Live Demonstration** (teacher performs while students observe):

1. Hold flashlight perpendicular to a piece of white paper
   - "Notice the bright, concentrated circle of light"

2. Tilt the flashlight to a shallow angle (about 20°)
   - "Now the same light spreads over a larger area—it's dimmer"

3. Ask: "Which angle would warm the paper more? Why?"

**Key Concept Introduction:**
When sunlight hits Earth at a high angle (near 90°), the energy is concentrated in a small area.
When sunlight hits at a low angle (near 0°), the same energy spreads over a large area.

**Formula Introduction:**
Solar intensity = Maximum intensity × sin(solar altitude)

At 90° altitude: sin(90°) = 1.0 (100% intensity)
At 30° altitude: sin(30°) = 0.5 (50% intensity)
At 15° altitude: sin(15°) = 0.26 (26% intensity)

**Bridge to Investigation:**
"Today you'll use the Sun in Sky app to determine the maximum solar altitude at locations around the world, then predict which locations receive the most energy and have the warmest climates."

## Main Activity - Day 1 (35 minutes)

### Part A: Solar Altitude and Climate Zone Investigation (25 minutes)

**Investigation Question:** How does latitude affect maximum solar altitude and climate?

**Scientific Setup:**
Students will investigate six locations representing different climate zones:

| Location | Latitude | Climate Zone | Mean Annual Temp |
|----------|----------|--------------|------------------|
| Singapore | 1°N | Tropical | 27°C (81°F) |
| Mumbai, India | 19°N | Tropical | 27°C (81°F) |
| Cairo, Egypt | 30°N | Arid/Subtropical | 22°C (72°F) |
| New York City | 41°N | Temperate | 13°C (55°F) |
| Reykjavik, Iceland | 64°N | Subarctic | 5°C (41°F) |
| Alert, Canada | 82°N | Polar | -18°C (0°F) |

**Data Collection Task:**
For each location, students will find the maximum solar altitude on three key dates:
- June Solstice (June 21, day 172)
- Equinox (March 21, day 80)
- December Solstice (December 21, day 355)

**Procedure:**
1. Set the app to the specified latitude
2. Set the date to June Solstice
3. Set time to Noon (12:00)
4. Record the solar altitude from the app
5. Repeat for the other two dates

**Data Table:**

| Location | Lat | Jun Solstice Max Alt | Equinox Max Alt | Dec Solstice Max Alt | Range (Jun-Dec) | Predicted Temp |
|----------|-----|---------------------|----------------|---------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Singapore | 1°N | | | | | |
| Mumbai | 19°N | | | | | |
| Cairo | 30°N | | | | | |
| New York | 41°N | | | | | |
| Reykjavik | 64°N | | | | | |
| Alert | 82°N | | | | | |

**Calculation Column: "Range"**
Calculate: (June Solstice altitude) - (December Solstice altitude)
This shows seasonal variation in solar altitude.

**Prediction Column:**
Before looking up actual temperatures, rank the locations from hottest (1) to coldest (6) based on solar altitude data.

### Part B: Analysis and Pattern Recognition (10 minutes)

**Guided Analysis Questions:**

1. **Altitude vs. Latitude Pattern:**
   - As latitude increases, what happens to maximum solar altitude?
   - Which location has the highest maximum altitude? When?
   - Which location has the lowest maximum altitude? When?

2. **Seasonal Variation:**
   - Which location has the smallest range between summer and winter solar altitude?
   - Which has the largest range?
   - What does this tell you about seasonal temperature variation?

3. **Climate Prediction:**
   - Compare your predicted temperature ranking to the actual temperatures
   - How accurate were your predictions?
   - What other factors might affect climate besides solar altitude? (ocean currents, elevation, prevailing winds)

4. **Extreme Cases:**
   - Singapore (1°N) has a maximum altitude of 89° in June but also 66° in December—why is it hot year-round?
   - Alert, Canada (82°N) has 24-hour daylight in summer but is still cold—why?

**Key Insights Students Should Discover:**

1. **Tropical zones** (low latitudes):
   - High solar altitude year-round (always >60° at some point)
   - Small seasonal variation
   - Consistently high temperatures
   - Sun reaches zenith (90°) twice per year between the tropics

2. **Temperate zones** (mid-latitudes):
   - Moderate solar altitudes (30°-70° range)
   - Large seasonal variation (20°-40° range)
   - Distinct seasons
   - Sun never reaches zenith

3. **Polar zones** (high latitudes):
   - Low solar altitudes (maximum <45°)
   - Extreme seasonal variation
   - Even during 24-hour daylight, sun is low on horizon
   - Sun never rises high enough to provide intense heating

## Main Activity - Day 2 (35 minutes)

### Part C: Solar Intensity Calculation (20 minutes)

**Investigation Question:** How does solar altitude affect the amount of energy reaching the ground?

**Scientific Background:**
The intensity of solar radiation is proportional to the sine of the solar altitude angle.

**Formula:**
Intensity = Maximum Intensity × sin(altitude)

Where maximum intensity (sun directly overhead) ≈ 1000 W/m²

**Calculation Task:**
Students calculate relative solar intensity for each location at summer solstice (June 21) at noon.

**Worked Example (teacher demonstrates):**
Singapore (1°N) on June 21:
- Maximum altitude = 89.5°
- Intensity = 1000 × sin(89.5°)
- Intensity = 1000 × 0.9999
- Intensity ≈ 1000 W/m²

**Student Calculations:**

| Location | Latitude | June Solstice Altitude | sin(altitude) | Intensity (W/m²) | % of Maximum |
|----------|----------|----------------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Singapore | 1°N | 89.5° | | | |
| Mumbai | 19°N | 87.5° | | | |
| Cairo | 30°N | 83.5° | | | |
| New York | 41°N | 72.5° | | | |
| Reykjavik | 64°N | 49.5° | | | |
| Alert | 82°N | 31.5° | | | |

**Graphing Activity:**
Create a bar graph showing:
- X-axis: Latitude
- Y-axis: Solar intensity (W/m²)
- One bar per location

**Analysis Questions:**
1. How much more intense is sunlight in Singapore compared to Alert?
2. At what latitude does intensity drop below 50% of maximum?
3. Why is this important for understanding climate zones?

### Part D: Energy Distribution Model (15 minutes)

**Conceptual Model Activity:**
Students draw diagrams showing how sunlight spreads over different areas.

**Drawing Exercise:**
1. Draw a beam of sunlight (represented by 5 parallel arrows) hitting Earth at 90°
   - Arrows spread over 5 cm of surface
   - Energy concentration: 5 arrows ÷ 5 cm = 1 arrow/cm

2. Draw the same beam hitting Earth at 30°
   - Use protractor to draw 30° angle
   - Same 5 arrows now spread over 10 cm of surface
   - Energy concentration: 5 arrows ÷ 10 cm = 0.5 arrows/cm

**Mathematical Connection:**
The spreading factor = 1 ÷ sin(angle)
- At 90°: spreading = 1 ÷ sin(90°) = 1 ÷ 1 = 1 (no spreading)
- At 30°: spreading = 1 ÷ sin(30°) = 1 ÷ 0.5 = 2 (doubles the area)
- At 10°: spreading = 1 ÷ sin(10°) = 1 ÷ 0.17 = 5.8 (almost 6 times the area!)

**Real-World Application:**
This is why:
- Solar panels are tilted to face the sun perpendicularly
- Greenhouse designers consider sun angle
- Architects design passive solar heating based on winter sun angle
- Climate zones follow latitude lines

## Optional Lab Extension: Experimental Verification (45 minutes)

### Angle of Incidence Experiment

1. 90° (perpendicular): Flashlight directly above paper
2. 45° (medium angle): Flashlight angled at 45°
3. 20° (shallow angle): Flashlight at shallow angle

**Procedure:**
1. Set up flashlight 20 cm above paper for 90° test
2. Place thermometer on black paper
3. Record starting temperature
4. Turn on flashlight
5. Record temperature every 30 seconds for 5 minutes

**Data Table:**

| Time | 90° Temp (°C) | 45° Temp (°C) | 20° Temp (°C) |
|------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| 0:00 | | | |
| 0:30 | | | |
| 1:00 | | | |
| 1:30 | | | |
| ... | | | |
| 5:00 | | | |

**Graphing:**
Create a line graph with three lines showing temperature change over time.

**Analysis Questions:**
1. Which angle produced the greatest temperature increase?
2. How does this relate to solar altitude and climate?
3. What was the temperature difference between 90° and 20° after 5 minutes?
4. How does this model Earth's climate zones?

## Teacher Notes & Tips

### Common Student Misconceptions

1. **"Hot climates are closest to the sun"**
   - Correction: Distance to sun varies only 3% over the year (due to elliptical orbit)
   - The angle matters far more than distance
   - Earth is actually closest to sun in January (Northern Hemisphere winter!)

2. **"24 hours of daylight = very hot"**
   - Correction: Low altitude sun provides weak heating
   - Total energy depends on both duration AND intensity
   - 1 hour at 90° delivers more energy than 24 hours at 10°

3. **"The equator is hot because it's on top of Earth"**
   - Correction: "Top" is arbitrary (there's no up/down in space)
   - Equator is hot because of high solar altitude year-round

4. **"Seasons are caused by Earth's distance from the sun"**
   - Correction: Seasons are caused by axial tilt changing solar altitude
   - Both hemispheres experience the same distance but opposite seasons

## Answer Key

### Part A: Solar Altitude Data (June Solstice at Noon)

| Location | Latitude | Jun 21 | Mar 21 | Dec 21 | Range | Rank (Hot→Cold) |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Singapore | 1°N | 89.5° | 89° | 66° | 23.5° | 1 (tied) |
| Mumbai | 19°N | 87.5° | 71° | 47.5° | 40° | 1 (tied) |
| Cairo | 30°N | 83.5° | 60° | 36.5° | 47° | 3 |
| New York | 41°N | 72.5° | 49° | 25.5° | 47° | 4 |
| Reykjavik | 64°N | 49.5° | 26° | 2.5° | 47° | 5 |
| Alert | 82°N | 31.5° | 8° | -15.5° | 47° | 6 |

**Pattern:** Lower latitudes have higher altitudes and higher temperatures.

### Part C: Solar Intensity Calculations

| Location | Altitude | sin(altitude) | Intensity (W/m²) | % Max |
|----------|----------|--------------|-----------------|--------|
| Singapore | 89.5° | 1.000 | 1000 | 100% |
| Mumbai | 87.5° | 0.999 | 999 | 99.9% |
| Cairo | 83.5° | 0.993 | 993 | 99.3% |
| New York | 72.5° | 0.954 | 954 | 95.4% |
| Reykjavik | 49.5° | 0.760 | 760 | 76.0% |
| Alert | 31.5° | 0.523 | 523 | 52.3% |

**Key Finding:** Alert receives only about half the solar intensity of Singapore, explaining the dramatic temperature difference despite 24-hour daylight.

### Optional Lab Expected Results

Typical temperature increases after 5 minutes:
- 90° angle: +8-12°C above starting temperature
- 45° angle: +5-8°C above starting temperature
- 20° angle: +2-4°C above starting temperature

**Relationship:** Higher angles produce more heating, confirming that solar altitude affects climate.

**Student Predictions:**
Have students draw a quick sketch predicting:
- Where would the hottest zone be on a planet tilted 82°?
- Where would ice caps form?
- Where would the arctic circles be located?

### Real-World Connection: Exoplanet Discovery

As of 2025, astronomers have discovered over 5,000 exoplanets. Key questions:
1. Could these planets have seasons?
2. Which might be habitable?
3. How does axial tilt affect habitability?

**NASA's Perspective:**
Scientists use models similar to Sun in Sky to predict:
- Surface temperatures on exoplanets
- Potential for liquid water
- Seasonal climate variation
- Habitability for life as we know it

**Career Connection:**
- Astrobiologists study conditions for life on other worlds
- Planetary scientists model climate on other planets
- Space mission planners must account for seasonal changes
- Future Mars colonists will need to understand Martian seasons

**Bridge to Investigation:**
"Today, you'll become planetary scientists. Using real astronomical data, you'll discover how changing one variable—axial tilt—completely transforms a planet's climate and seasons."

## Main Activity - Day 1 (40 minutes)

### Part A: Planetary Tilt Comparison Setup (10 minutes)

**Introduction to the Three Planets:**

**Earth (Our Baseline):**
- Axial tilt: 23.45°
- Tropics at: ±23.45°
- Arctic Circles at: ±66.55°
- Seasonal character: Moderate
- Year length: 365 days

**Mars (Earth's Sibling):**
- Axial tilt: 25.2°
- Tropics at: ±25.2°
- Arctic Circles at: ±64.8°
- Seasonal character: Similar to Earth but longer year
- Year length: 687 Earth days
- Additional factor: Highly elliptical orbit intensifies seasons

**Uranus (The Extreme):**
- Axial tilt: 82.23°
- Tropics at: ±82.23° (almost at the poles!)
- Arctic Circles at: ±7.77° (almost at the equator!)
- Seasonal character: Extreme polar seasons
- Year length: 84 Earth years
- Each pole experiences 42 years of daylight, then 42 years of darkness!

**App Setup Instructions:**
Students will use the "Axial Tilt" presets:
1. Set to 23.4° for Earth
2. Set to 25.2° for Mars
3. Set to 82.2° for Uranus

**Initial Observation:**
As students change the tilt, watch the yellow and blue markers on the latitude slider:
- Yellow ticks = Tropics (move closer to equator as tilt decreases, toward poles as tilt increases)
- Blue ticks = Arctic Circles (move closer to poles as tilt decreases, toward equator as tilt increases)

### Part B: Comparative Seasonal Analysis (30 minutes)

**Investigation Question:** How does axial tilt affect seasonal variation at mid-latitudes?

**Experimental Setup:**
- Test latitude: 45°N (mid-latitude for all three planets)
- Dates to test: Summer solstice and winter solstice
- View mode: Day View

**Data Collection: Earth (23.4° tilt)**

| Season | Date | Maximum Altitude at Noon | Minimum Altitude (Midnight) | Daylight Hours | Notes |
|--------|------|------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|--------|
| Summer | Jun 21 | | | | |
| Winter | Dec 21 | | | | |
| **Range** | | (Summer - Winter) | | | |

**Data Collection: Mars (25.2° tilt)**

Switch axial tilt to 25.2° and repeat:

| Season | Date | Maximum Altitude at Noon | Minimum Altitude (Midnight) | Daylight Hours | Notes |
|--------|------|------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|--------|
| Summer | Jun 21 | | | | |
| Winter | Dec 21 | | | | |
| **Range** | | (Summer - Winter) | | | |

**Data Collection: Uranus (82.2° tilt)**

Switch axial tilt to 82.2° and repeat:

| Season | Date | Maximum Altitude at Noon | Minimum Altitude (Midnight) | Daylight Hours | Notes |
|--------|------|------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|--------|
| Summer | Jun 21 | | | | |
| Winter | Dec 21 | | | | |
| **Range** | | (Summer - Winter) | | | |

**Comparative Analysis Table:**

| Planet | Axial Tilt | Summer Max Alt | Winter Max Alt | Range | Summer Daylight | Winter Daylight | Seasonal Severity |
|--------|-----------|---------------|---------------|-------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Earth | 23.4° | | | | | | Moderate |
| Mars | 25.2° | | | | | | |
| Uranus | 82.2° | | | | | | |

**Guided Discovery Questions:**

1. **Altitude Range:**
   - Which planet has the largest difference between summer and winter noon altitude?
   - How does this relate to axial tilt?
   - Calculate: For Earth, range ≈ 2 × tilt. Does this pattern hold for Mars? Uranus?

2. **Daylight Variation:**
   - Which planet has the most extreme daylight variation?
   - On Uranus at 45°N, does the sun set during summer solstice?
   - Does the sun rise during Uranus's winter solstice at 45°N?

3. **Habitability Implications:**
   - Which planet would have the most stable climate year-round?
   - Which would have the harshest seasonal extremes?
   - Could humans adapt to Uranus-like seasons?

**Key Discovery - The 2× Rule:**
Students should discover that the range in maximum solar altitude ≈ 2 × axial tilt:
- Earth: Range ≈ 47° (≈ 2 × 23.4°)
- Mars: Range ≈ 50° (≈ 2 × 25.2°)
- Uranus: Range ≈ 164° (≈ 2 × 82.2°)

## Main Activity - Day 2 (45 minutes)

### Part C: Geographic Boundary Investigation (20 minutes)

**Investigation Question:** How does axial tilt determine where tropics and arctic circles are located?

**Mathematical Prediction:**
Before using the app, students calculate expected boundaries:

**Formula Derivation:**
- **Tropic latitude** = axial tilt
  - This is where sun reaches zenith (90°) at solstice
- **Arctic Circle latitude** = 90° - axial tilt
  - This is where midnight sun/polar night begins

**Prediction Table:**

| Planet | Axial Tilt | Predicted Tropic Latitude | Predicted Arctic Circle | Climate Zone Size |
|--------|-----------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Mercury | 0° | | | |
| Earth | 23.4° | | | |
| Mars | 25.2° | | | |
| Uranus | 82.2° | | | |
| Hypothetical | 45° | | | |

**App Verification:**
Students set each tilt value and observe the yellow (tropic) and blue (arctic) markers on the latitude slider to verify their predictions.

**Calculation: Climate Zone Sizes**

For Earth:
- **Tropical zone**: From -23.4° to +23.4° = 46.8° total width
- **Temperate zones**: From 23.4° to 66.55° (North and South) = 43.15° width each
- **Polar zones**: From 66.55° to 90° (North and South) = 23.45° width each

Students calculate the same for Mars and Uranus.

**Graphical Representation:**
Students draw three circles representing the three planets, divided into zones:
- Color tropical zones red
- Color temperate zones green
- Color polar zones blue

**Analysis Questions:**

1. **Mercury (0° tilt):**
   - Where are the tropics? (Answer: Everywhere is "tropical" in terms of solar altitude, but it's not hot year-round—no atmosphere)
   - Are there arctic circles? (Answer: No, no location has midnight sun)
   - Describe the seasons. (Answer: No seasons, every day is the same)

2. **Earth (23.4° tilt):**
   - What percentage of Earth's surface is tropical? Temperate? Polar?
   - Why do most humans live in temperate zones?

3. **Uranus (82.2° tilt):**
   - The tropics are at ±82.2°—nearly at the poles! What does this mean?
   - Arctic circles are at ±7.7°—nearly at the equator! What does this mean?
   - What zone is largest on Uranus? (Polar zones cover almost the entire planet)

4. **Hypothetical 45° tilt:**
   - Tropics at ±45°
   - Arctic circles at ±45°
   - The tropics and arctic circles are at the SAME latitude!
   - What would this mean? (At 45° latitude, sun reaches zenith in summer AND you have midnight sun—extreme!)

**Critical Thinking:**
"If you could design a planet for maximum habitability and climate stability, what axial tilt would you choose? Why?"

### Part D: Extreme Tilt Exploration - Uranus in Detail (25 minutes)

**Investigation Focus:** Understanding Uranus's bizarre seasonal pattern

**Background Information:**
- Uranus's year = 84 Earth years
- Rotates "on its side" with 82.23° tilt
- During solstice, one pole points almost directly at the sun
- Essentially, the sun rises once and sets once every 84 years at the poles

**Comparative Study: Equator vs. Pole**

**At Uranus Equator (0° latitude):**
1. Set app to 82.2° tilt and 0° latitude
2. View Year View
3. Observe the pattern throughout the "year"

**Observations:**
- Does the sun ever reach zenith (90°)?
- What are the maximum and minimum altitudes?
- How does this compare to Earth's equator?

**At Uranus North Pole (90° latitude):**
1. Set latitude to 90°
2. Keep tilt at 82.2°
3. View Year View

**Observations:**
- During summer (Jun solstice), what is the sun's altitude? (Should be close to 82.2°—very high!)
- During winter (Dec solstice), what is the sun's altitude? (Should be about -82.2°—far below horizon)
- How many times does the sun cross the horizon per year? (Just twice—once up, once down)

**Mind-Bending Realization:**
At Uranus's pole:
- Sunrise occurs at the spring equinox
- Sun spirals upward for ~21 years
- Reaches maximum altitude at summer solstice
- Spirals downward for ~21 years
- Sets at fall equinox
- Stays dark for ~42 years
- Then the cycle repeats

**Creative Visualization Activity:**
Students create a diagram or comic strip showing "A Year in the Life of a Uranus Colonist at the North Pole":
- Panel 1: Equinox - "The sun is rising for the first time in 42 years!"
- Panel 2: 21 years later - "It's summer solstice, the sun is at its highest!"
- Panel 3: Another 21 years - "Sunset... won't see the sun again for 42 years"
- Panel 4: 42 years of darkness

**Mathematical Challenge:**
If Uranus has a similar rotation period to Earth (~17 hours per day), how many Uranian "days" are in one Uranian year?

Calculation:
- 84 Earth years = 84 × 365.25 = 30,681 Earth days
- 30,681 Earth days × 24 hours = 736,344 hours
- 736,344 hours ÷ 17 hours/Uranian day = ~43,315 Uranian days per year

**Discussion:** What would this mean for calendar systems, agriculture, and daily life?

## Assessment

### Formative Assessment

**During Investigation Monitoring:**
- Check that students correctly adjust axial tilt using presets
- Verify students are recording maximum altitude (at noon) correctly
- Ask students to predict before measuring: "If we increase tilt, what will happen to the range?"

**7. Historical Astronomy Research**

Investigate:
- How did ancient astronomers discover planetary tilts?
- When was Uranus's extreme tilt discovered?
- How do modern astronomers measure exoplanet tilts?
- Create a timeline of major discoveries

**8. Solar System Scale Model**

Create a physical model showing:
- All planets at correct tilt angles (use skewers through styrofoam balls)
- Labels showing tilt degree
- Color-coded climate zones on each planet
- Display stand with explanatory text

## Differentiation Strategies

### Support for Struggling Students

**Simplified Investigation:**
- Focus only on Earth vs. Uranus (skip Mars)
- Test only two latitudes: Equator and 45°N
- Test only two dates: Jun and Dec solstices
- Provide partially completed data tables
- Use fill-in-the-blank analysis questions

**Visual Supports:**
- Physical models: Use balls on sticks to show different tilts
- Color-coded worksheets: One color per planet
- Provide reference diagrams showing what "axial tilt" means
- Show animation or video of planetary tilts

**Calculation Support:**
- Provide tropic/arctic formulas on a reference card
- Use calculator or pre-calculated tables
- Focus on patterns rather than precise calculations
- Allow partner work for all calculations

**Modified Assessment:**
- Oral presentation instead of written report
- Comparison poster (visual) instead of data analysis
- Multiple choice questions about patterns
- Focus on one planet in depth rather than comparing three

### Challenges for Advanced Students

**Extended Investigations:**
1. **Obliquity Variations**: Research how moons stabilize axial tilt
   - Earth's moon keeps tilt stable at ~23.4°
   - Mars lacks large moon, tilt varies 15° to 35° over millions of years
   - Model both scenarios

2. **Orbital Eccentricity**:
   - Mars has highly elliptical orbit (0.09 eccentricity vs. Earth's 0.02)
   - This amplifies seasons in one hemisphere, dampens in other
   - Research and create model combining tilt + orbital effects

3. **Tidally Locked Planets**:
   - Many exoplanets are tidally locked (one side always faces star)
   - How would this interact with axial tilt?
   - What would "seasons" mean on such a world?

4. **Climate Modeling**:
   - Use actual Mars climate data from NASA rovers
   - Compare predicted solar patterns to measured temperatures
   - Account for thin atmosphere and dust storms
   - Create detailed climate model for one Martian location

## Teacher Notes & Tips

### Common Student Misconceptions

1. **"Higher tilt always means more extreme temperature"**
   - Correction: Tilt affects solar altitude, but atmosphere, albedo, and distance from star also matter
   - Venus has low tilt but is extremely hot (greenhouse effect)
   - Mars has similar tilt to Earth but is much colder (thin atmosphere, farther from sun)

2. **"Uranus is always extremely cold because it's far from the sun"**
   - Partially true: It is cold (-224°C average)
   - But tilt also creates extreme seasonal temperature variation
   - One pole gets continuous sunlight for 42 years, the other continuous darkness

3. **"Planets with no tilt have no climate zones"**
   - Correction: Even with 0° tilt, there are still latitude-based climate zones
   - Equator still receives more direct sunlight than poles
   - But there are no SEASONAL variations

4. **"The tropics are always hot"**
   - Depends on the planet!
   - On Uranus, "tropics" are at ±82° (near poles)—these are the coldest regions
   - "Tropical" just means "where sun can reach zenith"—not necessarily warm

### Preparation Checklist

**Before Class:**
- [ ] Test app tilt presets (23.4°, 25.2°, 82.2°)
- [ ] Print planetary fact sheets for reference
- [ ] Prepare physical models if using (balls and skewers)
- [ ] Load comparison images of planets
- [ ] Print data collection worksheets
- [ ] Prepare calculator or trig tables

**During Class:**
- [ ] Demonstrate how to change axial tilt using presets
- [ ] Show how latitude markers move when tilt changes
- [ ] Emphasize the relationship: Tropic = tilt, Arctic = 90 - tilt
- [ ] Remind students that we're modeling using same year length (365 days) for all planets for comparison
- [ ] Clarify that real planets have different year lengths (Mars 687 days, Uranus 84 years)

**After Class:**
- [ ] Review student calculations of boundaries
- [ ] Check for understanding of inverse relationship (tilt up → arctic circles move toward equator)
- [ ] Identify students struggling with abstract concept of extreme tilts
- [ ] Assess whether students grasp habitability implications

### Technical Tips

**App Usage for This Lesson:**
- Use the axial tilt slider and presets
- Watch the yellow (tropic) and blue (arctic) markers move
- When tilt > 45°, tropics and arctics overlap—this is scientifically accurate!
- Use Year View to see full seasonal cycle
- Use Day View to see specific solstice patterns

**Common App Confusion:**
- Students may not realize the latitude markers update automatically with tilt
- Point out the "Tropic: ±__°" and "Arctic: ±__°" labels below the tilt slider
- Demonstrate that these values always equal tilt and (90-tilt) respectively

## Answer Key

### Part B: Comparative Seasonal Analysis (45°N)

| Planet | Tilt | Summer Max | Winter Max | Range | Summer Day | Winter Day |
|--------|------|-----------|-----------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Earth | 23.4° | 68.4° | 21.6° | 46.8° | ~15.5h | ~8.5h |
| Mars | 25.2° | 70.2° | 19.8° | 50.4° | ~16h | ~8h |
| Uranus | 82.2° | 127.2° | -37.2° | 164.4° | 24h | 0h |

**Key Insights:**
- Uranus at 45°N experiences midnight sun in summer and polar night in winter!
- Range approximately equals 2× the axial tilt
- Extreme tilt creates extreme seasons

### Part C: Geographic Boundaries

| Planet | Tilt | Tropic Lat | Arctic Lat | Climate Zones |
|--------|------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| Mercury | 0° | 0° (none) | 90° (none) | All temperate (but no seasons) |
| Earth | 23.4° | ±23.4° | ±66.6° | Balanced |
| Mars | 25.2° | ±25.2° | ±64.8° | Similar to Earth |
| Uranus | 82.2° | ±82.2° | ±7.8° | Almost all polar |
| 45° Hypothetical | 45° | ±45° | ±45° | Tropics = Arctic (extreme!) |

**Climate Zone Sizes:**

**Earth:**
- Tropical: 47° of latitude (26% of surface)
- Temperate: 43° each hemisphere (48% total)
- Polar: 23.4° each pole (26% total)

**Uranus:**
- Tropical: 164° of latitude (91% of surface—but "tropical" means near poles!)
- Temperate: Only 15° in each hemisphere (8% total)
- Polar: Most of the planet experiences polar phenomena

### Part D: Uranus at the Pole (90°N)

- Summer solstice altitude: 82.2° (very high!)
- Winter solstice altitude: -82.2° (far below horizon)
- Sunrise: Spring equinox
- Sunset: Fall equinox
- Continuous daylight: ~42 Earth years
- Continuous darkness: ~42 Earth years
