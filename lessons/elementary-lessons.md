## Lesson 1: Day and Night - Why Does the Sun Move Across the Sky?

### Grade Level
Grades 3-4 (Ages 8-10)

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Explain that the sun appears to move across the sky from east to west during the day
2. Identify sunrise and sunset on the Sun in Sky visualization
3. Understand that daylight hours change throughout the year
4. Describe how the sun's position affects whether it is day or night

### Materials Needed
- Computer or tablet with Sun in Sky app (one per pair of students, or use projector)
- Student observation worksheet (provided below)
- Pencils
- Optional: Globe or ball and flashlight

### Vocabulary
- **Sunrise**: The moment when the sun's upper edge first appears at the horizon (altitude = 0°)
- **Sunset**: The moment when the sun's upper edge disappears below the horizon (altitude = 0°)
- **Horizon**: The line where the sky appears to meet the ground (0° altitude)
- **Altitude**: How high the sun is in the sky (measured in degrees, 0° = horizon, 90° = directly overhead)
- **Noon**: When the sun is at its highest point in the sky (solar noon, usually close to 12:00 clock time)

### Introduction (10 minutes)

**Engagement Question**: "Who here has ever watched a sunrise or sunset? What did you notice about where the sun was in the sky?"

**Activity - The Human Sun**:
1. Choose one student to be the "sun" and stand in the center of the classroom
2. Ask: "If I'm standing on Earth and the sun is here, where should I look in the morning? At noon? In the evening?"
3. Have students point to show where they think the sun would be at different times
4. Explain: "Today we're going to use a special computer tool to see exactly how the sun moves across the sky!"

**Connect to Experience**: "Have you noticed that in summer, it stays light outside longer than in winter? We're going to discover why!"

### Main Activity (25 minutes)

**Part 1: Exploring a Single Day (15 minutes)**

**Step 1 - Set Up the App**:
- Open Sun in Sky app
- Click "Day" view mode (if not already selected)
- Set latitude to 45° (Mid) - a middle location
- Click "Mar Equinox" to start with an equal day

**Step 2 - Identify Key Features**:
Point out to students:
- The orange dashed line across the middle is the **horizon** (0°)
- The curved line shows the sun's path through the sky
- The purple dot shows where the sun is right now
- The orange circle shows **sunrise** (when the sun crosses the horizon going up)
- The red circle shows **sunset** (when the sun crosses the horizon going down)

**Step 3 - Guided Exploration**:
Ask students to observe and answer these questions as you move the time slider:

1. **Morning Questions**:
   - Click "Dawn" (6:00 AM). Ask: "Is the sun above or below the horizon?"
   - "What color is the area below the horizon?" (Blue - this represents night)
   - "Is it daytime or nighttime at 6:00 AM?" (Look at the stats - it should show the sun is rising)

2. **Noon Questions**:
   - Click "Noon" (12:00 PM). Ask: "Where is the sun now?"
   - "Is it higher or lower than at dawn?" (Much higher!)
   - "Look at the altitude number - how high is the sun?" (Around 45° at this latitude)

3. **Evening Questions**:
   - Click "Dusk" (6:00 PM). Ask: "What's happening to the sun now?"
   - "How is this different from dawn?" (Sun is setting instead of rising)

4. **Night Questions**:
   - Move slider to 10:00 PM. Ask: "Where is the sun now?"
   - "Can we see the sun when it's below the horizon?" (No - that's why it's nighttime!)

**Step 4 - Animation**:
- Click the play button (purple triangle) to animate the sun's movement
- Watch together as the sun rises, reaches its highest point, and sets
- Ask: "Which direction does the sun move?" (Left to right, or east to west)

**Part 2: Comparing Different Seasons (10 minutes)**

**Step 1 - Summer Day**:
- Click "Jun Solstice" (first day of summer)
- Ask: "Look at the 'Daylight' number. How many hours of daylight do we have?" (About 15-16 hours)
- "Is the sun's path higher or lower than before?" (Higher!)
- Point out the gray dashed line - this shows where the sun was during the equinox for comparison

**Step 2 - Winter Day**:
- Click "Dec Solstice" (first day of winter)
- Ask: "How many hours of daylight now?" (About 8-9 hours)
- "Is the sun's path higher or lower than summer?" (Much lower!)
- "Why do you think winter days are shorter?" (The sun doesn't get as high and sets earlier)

**Step 3 - Discovery Discussion**:
- "What did you notice about how the sun's path changes between summer and winter?"
- "When does the sun get highest in the sky - summer or winter?"
- "When do we have more daylight hours - summer or winter?"

### Assessment

**Observation Checklist** (teacher uses during activity):
- Can students identify sunrise and sunset on the graph?
- Do students understand that the sun is highest at noon?
- Can students explain why we have more daylight in summer?

**Exit Ticket** (students answer on paper or verbally):
1. Draw a simple picture showing where the sun is at sunrise, noon, and sunset
2. True or False: The sun gets higher in the sky in winter than in summer. (False)
3. In your own words: Why do we have longer days in summer?

**Student Observation Worksheet**:
```
Name: _________________ Date: _____________

Sun's Journey Across the Sky

1. At sunrise, the sun is:  ☐ On the horizon (0°)  ☐ High in the sky

2. At noon (12:00), the sun is at its _________ point in the sky.

3. In summer, we have _______ hours of daylight than in winter.
   (more / fewer)

4. The sun appears to move from ________ to ________ across the sky.
   (east to west / west to east)

5. Draw the sun's path on this picture:
   [Simple diagram with horizon line and space above/below]

   Label: Sunrise, Noon, Sunset
```

### Extension Activities

**For Advanced Students**:
1. **Latitude Challenge**: Try different latitude presets (Equator, Tropic, Arctic). What happens to daylight hours? Which location has the longest summer day?

2. **Pattern Detectives**: Use the "Year" view and click "Noon" to keep the time constant. Watch how the sun's noon height changes throughout the year. Can you find when the sun is highest? Lowest?

3. **Weather Connection**: Research actual sunrise and sunset times for your city on different dates. How close are they to what the app shows?

**For Students Needing Support**:
1. **Time of Day Match**: Give students pictures of morning, noon, and evening activities. Have them use the app to match each picture to the sun's position.

2. **Daylight Detective**: Use only the four time presets (Midnight, Dawn, Noon, Dusk) and one season. Focus on identifying when the sun is up vs. down.

### Connections to Other Subjects

**Math**:
- Counting and comparing daylight hours
- Understanding degrees (the sun's altitude is measured in degrees)
- Reading graphs and charts
- Greater than/less than comparisons (more/fewer daylight hours)

**Geography**:
- Understanding that different locations on Earth experience different sun patterns
- Introduction to latitude concept
- Map skills (finding where you live on a globe)

**Art**:
- Create a sunrise/noon/sunset triptych painting showing the sun at different positions
- Design a sundial based on sun movement observations
- Photograph shadows at different times of day and compare

**Language Arts**:
- Write a story from the sun's perspective as it travels across the sky
- Keep a "Sun Journal" noting sunrise and sunset times over a week
- Read books about day and night cycles

**Science Connections**:
- Shadows change length based on sun position
- Plants need sunlight for photosynthesis (more summer daylight = more growing time)
- Animals have different activity patterns based on day/night

### Teacher Tips

**Before the Lesson**:
- Familiarize yourself with the app controls, especially the play/pause button and preset buttons
- Test that the app loads properly on your classroom devices
- Consider creating a short video walkthrough if students will work independently

**During the Lesson**:
- Use a projector for whole-class demonstrations before letting students explore
- Encourage students to use the play button to watch the sun move (it's mesmerizing!)
- Remind students that the altitude numbers show how high the sun is (bigger number = higher)

**Common Student Questions**:
- "Why does the sun move?" (It appears to move because Earth is rotating)
- "What are those gray circles?" (Sunrise and sunset markers in year view - focus on day view for this lesson)
- "What's that gray dotted line?" (The equinox reference - shows where the sun was on the first day of spring/fall)

**Differentiation Ideas**:
- Partner strong readers with emerging readers for vocabulary support
- Provide sentence frames: "At noon, the sun is _____ in the sky because _____"
- Use physical gestures (arm movements) to show sun rising and setting

## Lesson 2: Seasons - Why Is Summer Hot and Winter Cold?

### Grade Level
Grades 4-5 (Ages 9-11)

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Explain that Earth's tilt causes seasons, not Earth's distance from the sun
2. Describe how the sun's path height changes throughout the year
3. Identify the four key dates: two equinoxes and two solstices
4. Connect the sun's altitude to temperature (higher sun = warmer)

### Materials Needed
- Computer or tablet with Sun in Sky app (one per pair of students)
- Globe with axis tilt marked
- Flashlight or lamp
- Student data recording sheet
- Graph paper (for extension)
- Optional: Thermometer for outdoor measurements

### Vocabulary
- **Seasons**: The four divisions of the year (spring, summer, fall, winter) with different weather patterns
- **Equinox**: A day when daylight and nighttime are equal (about 12 hours each) - happens in March and September
- **Solstice**: A day when we have the most (summer) or least (winter) daylight - happens in June and December
- **Tilt**: Earth is tilted on its axis at 23.45 degrees, which causes seasons
- **Solar altitude**: How high the sun gets in the sky (higher = warmer temperatures)

### Introduction (10 minutes)

**Mystery Question**: Write on the board: "Why is it hot in summer and cold in winter?"

Take student predictions. Common (incorrect) answer: "Because Earth is closer to the sun in summer!"

**The Distance Myth Buster**:
- Show a globe: "Earth's distance from the sun actually doesn't change much."
- "Even more interesting: When it's summer in the United States, it's winter in Australia! How can that be if it's about distance?"
- "The real reason has to do with how Earth is tilted. Let's investigate!"

**Demonstration**:
1. Hold a tilted globe and shine a flashlight (the sun) on it
2. Show how when the North Pole tilts toward the light, the Northern Hemisphere gets more direct light
3. "We're going to use the Sun in Sky app to discover exactly how this tilt changes the sun's path!"

### Main Activity (30 minutes)

**Part 1: The Four Special Days (15 minutes)**

**Setup**:
- Open Sun in Sky app in "Day" view
- Set latitude to 45° (Mid) - this is about where most US students live
- Keep axial tilt at 23.45° (Earth's tilt)

**Investigation - March Equinox (First Day of Spring)**:
1. Click "Mar Equinox" button
2. Record observations:
   - "How many hours of daylight?" (Should be 12 hours)
   - "How high does the sun get at noon?" (About 45° at this latitude)
   - "Where does the sun rise and set?" (Due east and west)

**Investigation - June Solstice (First Day of Summer)**:
1. Click "Jun Solstice" button
2. Notice the gray dashed line - this shows the equinox path for comparison
3. Record observations:
   - "How many hours of daylight?" (About 15-16 hours)
   - "Is the sun's path higher or lower than the equinox?" (Higher!)
   - "How high does the sun get at noon?" (About 68° - much higher!)
   - "What do you think this means for temperature?" (Higher sun = warmer!)

**Investigation - September Equinox (First Day of Fall)**:
1. Click "Sep Equinox" button
2. Record observations:
   - "How many hours of daylight?" (12 hours again - same as March!)
   - "Is this path the same as March equinox?" (Yes - identical!)

**Investigation - December Solstice (First Day of Winter)**:
1. Click "Dec Solstice" button
2. Record observations:
   - "How many hours of daylight?" (About 8-9 hours - shortest day!)
   - "How high does the sun get at noon?" (About 22° - very low!)
   - "Compare this to June - which sun would feel warmer?" (June - much higher in sky)

**Key Discovery Discussion**:
- "What pattern do you notice about the sun's height and the season?"
- "When is the sun highest? When is it lowest?"
- "How does the sun's height explain why summer is hot and winter is cold?"

**The Science Connection**:
"When the sun is high in the sky (summer), its rays hit Earth more directly and are concentrated in a smaller area - like pointing a flashlight straight down at a table. When the sun is low (winter), the same amount of sunlight spreads out over a bigger area - like shining the flashlight at an angle. That's why it's colder!"

**Part 2: Watching Seasons Change (15 minutes)**

**Year View Investigation**:
1. Switch to "Year" view mode
2. Click "Noon" button (this keeps the time at noon throughout the year)
3. Point out the season markers:
   - Green line: Spring equinox
   - Yellow line: Summer solstice
   - Orange line: Fall equinox
   - Blue line: Winter solstice

**Guided Observation**:
- "Look at the overall shape. Does it look like any letter?" (Like a hill or curve)
- "When is the sun highest all year?" (Summer solstice - the peak)
- "When is it lowest?" (Winter solstice - the valley)
- "How would you describe the change from winter to summer?" (The sun gradually gets higher)

**Animation Exploration**:
1. Click the play button and watch the purple dot move through the year
2. "Watch how the sun's noon height changes slowly over the year"
3. "Notice how the sun 'climbs' from winter to summer, then 'falls' from summer to winter"

**Seasonal Prediction Challenge**:
Ask students: "If we know the sun's height at noon, can we predict which season it is?"
- Sun at 22° → Winter
- Sun at 45° → Spring or Fall (equinox)
- Sun at 68° → Summer

### Assessment

**Data Collection Sheet** (completed during activity):
```

```

**Understanding Check Questions**:
1. **Multiple Choice**: Why do we have seasons?
   - A) Earth gets closer and farther from the sun
   - B) Earth's tilt changes how high the sun gets in the sky ✓
   - C) The sun gets hotter and colder
   - D) Clouds block the sun in winter

2. **Short Answer**: "Explain in your own words why summer is warmer than winter using what you learned about the sun's path."

3. **Application**: "If the sun at noon is 30° high in the sky, is it more likely to be summer or winter? Explain."

**Demonstration of Understanding**:
Have students create a simple diagram showing:
- Earth with tilt marked
- Sun position for summer (North Pole tilted toward sun)
- Sun position for winter (North Pole tilted away from sun)
- Labels explaining which gets more direct sunlight

### Extension Activities

**For Advanced Students**:

1. **Opposite Seasons Challenge**:
   - Set latitude to -45° (Southern Hemisphere)
   - Explore the same four seasonal dates
   - Compare: When it's summer in the north (June), what's happening in the south?

   - Adjust the axial tilt to 0°
   - "What happens to seasons on a planet with no tilt?"
   - Record your observations: daylight hours, sun height changes
   - Write a paragraph: "Life on a planet with no seasons would be..."

3. **Extreme Tilt Planet (Uranus)**:
   - Set axial tilt to 82.2° (Uranus preset)
   - Set latitude to 45° and explore the seasons
   - "How are seasons different on Uranus?"
   - Research: What would seasons be like on Uranus?

**For Students Needing Support**:

1. **Four Seasons Match**:
   - Create cards with season names and characteristics
   - Use only the four season preset buttons
   - Match each sun pattern to the correct season name

2. **Before and After**:
   - Focus on just two dates: Jun Solstice and Dec Solstice

### Teacher Tips

**Before the Lesson**:
- Practice switching between Day and Year views smoothly
- Prepare the globe and flashlight demonstration
- Consider creating a anchor chart showing the four key dates
- Have sentence frames ready for explaining: "Summer is warmer because..."

**During the Lesson**:
- Emphasize that the tilt stays the same - Earth's position around the sun changes
- Use the equinox reference line (gray dashed) to help students compare heights
- If students struggle with degrees, use relative terms: "really high," "medium," "low"
- Pause frequently to have students share observations with a partner

**Common Misconceptions to Address**:
- "We're closer to the sun in summer" - Actually, Earth is slightly FARTHER from the sun during Northern Hemisphere summer!
- "The tilt changes" - The tilt angle stays constant; Earth's position in its orbit changes
- "Seasons happen at the same time everywhere" - Opposite hemispheres have opposite seasons

**Vocabulary Support**:
- Create a word wall with the five key terms and visual representations
- Use hand gestures: arms spread wide for solstice (extreme), hands together for equinox (equal)
- Provide a vocabulary reference sheet with diagrams

**Real-World Connections**:
- Discuss why farmers plant in spring (sun getting higher = warmer)
- Explain why some birds migrate (following the sun/warmth)
- Connect to students' experiences: "Have you noticed it gets dark earlier in winter?"

### Introduction (10 minutes)

**Hook - Where in the World?**:
"Imagine you're talking to a pen pal who lives far away. How would you describe exactly where you live on Earth? We use something called LATITUDE to describe how far north or south we are!"

**Globe Demonstration**:
1. Show a globe with latitude lines marked
2. "The equator is 0° - right in the middle"
3. "The North Pole is 90° North - the very top"
4. "The South Pole is 90° South - the very bottom"
5. Find your city: "We live at about ___° latitude"

**The Big Question**:
"Does the sun act the same everywhere on Earth? Or does it matter WHERE you live? Let's investigate!"

**Prediction Activity**:
Ask students to predict: "Who do you think has longer summer days - someone living near the equator or someone living near the North Pole?" (Take votes, revisit at end)

### Main Activity (30 minutes)

**Part 1: The Equator Experience (8 minutes)**

**Setup**:
- Open Sun in Sky app in "Day" view
- Click "0° Equator" latitude preset

2. "Now click Jun Solstice. How many hours now?" (Still about 12!)
3. "Click Dec Solstice. Still 12 hours?"
4. "What's special about the equator?" (Always has about the same amount of daylight year-round!)

**Switch to Year View**:
- Click "Year" view, then "Noon" to see noon sun height all year
- "Look at the shape - does it change a lot?" (Changes, but stays relatively high)
- "At the equator, the sun is always pretty high in the sky!"

**Equator Discovery**:
"At the equator, every day is like spring - about 12 hours of daylight year-round! There aren't really seasons like we have. It's almost always warm because the sun is always high in the sky."

**Part 2: Mid-Latitude Experience (Your Home!) (8 minutes)**

**Setup**:
- Click "45° Mid" preset (or manually set to your actual latitude if you know it)
- Start at "Mar Equinox" in Day view

**Compare to Equator**:
1. "At the equinox, how many hours?" (12 - same as equator)
2. "Now Jun Solstice - how many hours?" (About 15-16 hours - much more than equator!)
3. "Dec Solstice - how many hours?" (About 8-9 hours - much less!)

**Year View Comparison**:
- Switch to Year view, click "Noon"
- "Compare this curve to the equator - what's different?"
- "The sun height changes A LOT more at middle latitudes!"
- "This is why we have strong seasons - big changes in sun height and daylight!"

**Home Connection**:
"This is close to where WE live! This is why we have warm summers and cold winters. At the equator, they don't have these big changes."

**Part 3: The Poles - Extreme Latitude (8 minutes)**

**Setup**:
- Click "90° Pole" preset (North Pole)
- Start at "Mar Equinox" in Day view

**Observe the Extreme**:
1. "Look at the graph - can you see the sun's full path?" (Yes, it circles above and below the horizon)
2. "At the equinox, how many hours of daylight?" (12 hours - same as everywhere!)

**Summer at the Pole**:
- Click "Jun Solstice"
- "Look at the graph - is the sun EVER below the horizon?" (No!)
- "Look at daylight hours - what does it say?" (24 hours!)
- Point out the message: "☀ Midnight Sun"
- "At the North Pole in summer, the sun never sets! It just circles around and around in the sky!"

**Winter at the Pole**:
- Click "Dec Solstice"
- "Now look - is the sun EVER above the horizon?" (No!)
- "Daylight hours?" (0 hours!)
- Point out: "● Polar Night"
- "In winter at the North Pole, the sun never rises! It's dark for months!"

**Mind-Blowing Fact**:
"At the poles, you have 6 months of continuous daylight, then 6 months of continuous darkness! Imagine living where the sun doesn't set for half the year!"

**Part 4: Student Exploration (6 minutes)**

Give pairs of students 5-6 minutes to explore latitudes freely:

**Exploration Challenges**:
1. "Find a latitude where summer day is exactly 18 hours long"
2. "Find the latitude that has the biggest difference between summer and winter daylight"
3. "Find a latitude where you get midnight sun in summer"
4. "Test the Tropics (23.45°) - what's special about this latitude?"

**Share Discoveries**: Have 2-3 pairs share something interesting they found

### Teacher Tips

**Before the Lesson**:
- Look up your city's latitude (easy to find online: "latitude of [city name]")
- Prepare sticky notes or pins to mark student locations on a large world map
- Consider inviting a guest speaker who has traveled to extreme latitudes
- Bookmark latitude lookup website for student use during extension activities

**During the Lesson**:
- Keep a world map or globe visible throughout
- Use consistent color coding: Equator (green), Mid-latitude (yellow), Pole (blue)
- When showing extreme latitudes, emphasize "this is REAL - people really live here!"
- Encourage students to relate to their own experience: "Have you noticed...?"

**Common Student Questions**:
- "Why is latitude measured in degrees?" (It's an angle from Earth's center)
- "What's the difference between latitude and longitude?" (Latitude = north/south, longitude = east/west)
- "Do people really live at the North Pole?" (Scientific researchers visit, but no permanent communities; focus on places like northern Alaska, northern Canada, Norway, etc.)
- "Why does the equator have the same daylight year-round?" (The tilt affects it least)

**Differentiation Strategies**:
- Provide a simplified latitude reference sheet: Equator (0°), Tropics (23°), Mid (45°), Arctic (67°), Pole (90°)
- Use physical gestures: stand straight for equator, lean far for poles
- Create a human model: students stand in a line representing different latitudes
- For ELL students: provide labeled world map with key latitudes marked

**Real-World Connections**:
- Show photos of midnight sun from Alaska or Norway (search "midnight sun" images)
- Discuss animals that live at different latitudes and their adaptations
- Connect to current events: researchers at Antarctic stations
- Sports: Winter Olympics often held at specific latitudes
- Agriculture: What crops grow where based on sun patterns

**Assessment Tips**:
- Look for understanding of relative concepts (more/less, higher/lower) not just exact numbers
- Accept approximate daylight hours (app shows decimals, round to nearest hour is fine)
- Watch for the key insight: latitude affects sun patterns significantly
- Check that students can identify their own latitude's pattern

3. "Which location has the most extreme seasonal change?" (Reykjavik - near arctic)

4. "What pattern do you see in the numbers?" (The farther from equator, the more extreme the seasons)

**Part 3: Extreme Phenomena Investigation (5 minutes)**

**Midnight Sun Challenge**:
"Let's find out exactly where midnight sun happens!"

1. Set date to Jun Solstice (Day view)
2. Start at latitude 60° and slowly increase
3. "At what latitude does the sun NEVER go below the horizon?" (Around 66.6° - the Arctic Circle!)
4. Point out the message: "☀ Midnight Sun"
5. "This is why it's called the Arctic Circle - it's the boundary of midnight sun!"

**Polar Night Challenge**:
1. Keep same latitude (66.6°)
2. Change date to Dec Solstice
3. "What happened?" (Now it's Polar Night - sun never rises!)
4. "The Arctic Circle has BOTH phenomena - midnight sun in summer AND polar night in winter!"

**Mind-Blowing Comparison**:
- Set to 90° (Pole), Year view, click Noon
- "Look at this pattern - it's completely different from anywhere else!"

- Create a large display showing all four locations
- Consider showing a brief video of midnight sun (many available on YouTube)
- Prepare data collection sheets to save time

**During the Lesson**:
- Model collecting data for the first location together
- Circulate to ensure students are reading the app correctly
- Remind students to record degrees (°) and hours (hrs) units
- Use "think-pair-share" strategy when analyzing patterns
- Create anchor charts with student discoveries

**Facilitation Strategies**:
- Pair strong readers with emerging readers for data collection
- Provide calculator for students who struggle with subtraction
- Use color coding: Equator (red), Tropics (orange), Mid (yellow), Arctic (blue)
- Model scientific language: "We observed that...", "The data shows..."
- Celebrate "a-ha!" moments when students discover patterns

**Common Student Discoveries** (encourage these!):
- "The equator is the most boring - it never changes!"
- "Iceland sounds hard to live in - such short winter days!"
- "I notice the numbers go up as you go north in summer"
- "All the places have 12 hours at equinox!"

**Addressing Misconceptions**:
- "Hot = long days": Not necessarily! Angle matters more than hours (Singapore has 12 hrs but very hot because sun is nearly overhead)
- "All seasons same everywhere": Emphasize opposite hemispheres
- "Midnight sun everywhere in summer": Only above Arctic/Antarctic Circle

- **Kinesthetic learners**: Have students act out sun paths with their arms
- **Linguistic learners**: Focus on written explanations and comparisons
- **Logical learners**: Emphasize pattern recognition and data analysis
- **Advanced**: Add more locations, explore Southern Hemisphere
- **Support needed**: Provide pre-filled data tables to analyze instead of collect

**Technology Tips**:
- If devices are limited, assign one location per pair, then share findings
- Screenshot interesting findings to include in reports
- If projecting, practice smoothly switching between locations
- Have backup paper activity in case of technical issues

**Assessment Strategies**:
- **Formative**: Circulate during data collection, ask probing questions
- **Observation**: Note which students recognize patterns independently
- **Peer assessment**: Have students review each other's data for accuracy
- **Self-assessment**: "What was most surprising? What do you still wonder?"

- Show travel brochures from Norway advertising midnight sun
- Discuss solar energy potential at different latitudes
- Connect to current events: climate change affecting Arctic regions
- Invite a guest who has traveled to extreme latitudes
- Discuss athletes training at high altitude (different concept - clarify!)
- Agricultural implications: growing seasons, types of crops

**Extension Connection**:
This lesson sets up perfectly for a "Where Should We Build?" project where students use sun data to make decisions about agriculture, solar energy, tourism, etc.

**Time Management**:
- If short on time, assign two locations per pair instead of four
- Can split into two days: Day 1 = data collection, Day 2 = analysis
- Consider making data collection a homework assignment (with parent support)

- **Daylight Hours**: Total time sun is above horizon
- **Declination**: Sun's position relative to equator (-23.45° to +23.45°)

### Common Questions & Simple Answers

**Q: Why is summer warmer than winter?**
A: In summer, the sun is higher in the sky, so its light hits Earth more directly. In winter, the sun is lower, so the same amount of light spreads out over a bigger area.

**Q: Why don't we have seasons at the equator?**
A: The equator gets hit by the sun at about the same angle all year round. Places farther north or south see bigger changes in the sun's angle because of Earth's tilt.

**Q: What causes midnight sun?**
A: At latitudes above the Arctic Circle (66.6°), Earth's tilt during summer means the sun doesn't drop below the horizon - it just circles around the sky!

**Q: Do all places have equal day/night at the equinox?**
A: Yes! On the equinox (March 20 and September 22), everywhere on Earth has about 12 hours of daylight.

**Q: Why are there tropics and arctic circles?**
A: They're mathematical results of Earth's 23.45° tilt. The tropics (at ±23.45°) mark where the sun can be directly overhead. The arctic circles (at ±66.55°) mark where midnight sun and polar night occur.

### Vocabulary Support - Simple Definitions for Students

**Altitude**: How high up the sun is in the sky (like climbing stairs - higher altitude means higher up!)

**Equator**: The imaginary line around the middle of Earth, exactly between the North and South Poles

**Equinox**: A special day (happens twice a year) when everywhere on Earth has approximately 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of nighttime

**Horizon**: The line where the sky meets the ground (when the sun is at the horizon, it's sunrise or sunset)

**Latitude**: A number that tells how far north or south you are from the equator (0° = equator, 90° = North Pole)

**Midnight Sun**: When the sun stays in the sky all day and all night - it never sets!

**Polar Night**: When the sun stays below the horizon all day - it never rises!

**Seasons**: The four parts of the year (spring, summer, fall, winter) that have different weather

**Solstice**: A special day (happens twice a year) - the longest day of the year (summer solstice) or the shortest day (winter solstice)

**Tilt**: Earth is tilted like a leaning tower - this tilt is what causes seasons!
